                <p class="paragraph">For long, India had been pigeonholed as ‘a vibrant country that has an eclectic mix of cultures and religions’ While there is nothing wrong about that but India’s growing economy was never the focal point of any conversation or article about the country. However, things have changed over the last couple of decades and particularly in the 2010s. India’s rapidly developing and ever expanding economy has now become the subject of discussion in the outside world. And for this very reason, India has become a highly lucrative destination for people from across the globe. While a large number of people continue to move out of the country in search of better employment opportunities, there has been a rapid increase in the number of people moving in to India for similar reasons; and this includes both foreigners and Indian expats. In particular, there has been a steady flow of people shifting from Dubai to India. Dubai’s extremely high, and often unaffordable cost of living, coupled with India’s booming job market and favourable entrepreneurial environment, have attracted Indian expats and coerced many of them to move back to the country.
                <br> <br>
                India’s promise as a land of entrepreneurial opportunities has also encouraged Emirati citizens outside of Dubai to move to India. People from Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Aiman, Fujairah, etc. have expanded their business to India or have set up a new one in the country. The incentives for them for relocating to India are pretty strong as well, and quite similar to those for residents of Dubai. A decade or two ago, most businessmen from these areas had more or less just one option if they wanted to move to another city for better job opportunities or for business expansion - Dubai. But now, with all the perks that a relocation to India offers, they have another option at their disposal, and arguably a better and more affordable one. And it should come as no surprise to anyone that a number of them are exploring this option or have at least warmed up to the idea.
                <br> <br>
                In recent years, the UAE government has launched a programme known as ‘Emiratisation’. This programme is aimed at reducing unemployment among UAE citizens. This has put tremendous pressure on companies to reduce employment opportunities for foreign workers. Almost half of UAE’s total population is made up of expats. The Emiratisation programme has made it difficult for them to continue working in the UAE and has vastly reduced the number of employment opportunities for new migrants as well. This has forced many foreign nationals currently working in the UAE to look towards other countries for good jobs, and India is the destination most of them have focused their gaze towards.

                <p class="paragraph">
                Even while Emiratisation has made it difficult for expats to find jobs in the UAE, the country continues to be a highly sought after place for entrepreneurs and investors. If you are a foreign national who wants to start a business in the UAE, the government would grant you a 3-year investment visa, provided that you pay a deposit of AED 10,000 to AED 20,000 to prove that you have enough funds to make the supposed investment and sustain a business. A benefit of getting an investor visa is that you would not be liable to pay tax in the UAE. Writer Relocations provides prompt and reliable service for all your visa and immigration requirements in the UAE and many other countries of the world.
                <br><br>
                Most expats, Indian or otherwise, prefer to live in Dubai among all the 7 cities of the UAE. It is the most liberal city in the country and has a host of tourist attractions and a buzzing nightlife, both of which attract the young expat community. Indians would feel at home in Dubai as there is a large Indian expat population in this city. The easy availability of an investor visa, the prospect of living a lavish lifestyle, an abundance of quality educational institutes, and the presence of a thriving Indian community, together make shifting to Dubai from India a very attractive idea for ambitious Indian citizens.
